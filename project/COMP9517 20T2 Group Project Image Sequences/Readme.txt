Each of the three folders contains one image sequence showing many moving and dividing cells.

The files in each folder are the successive time points of the sequence and are named t***.tif accordingly, where *** is the number of the time point.

Use these images only for the COMP9517 2020 Term 2 Group Project and for no other purpose.

If you want to use these images for other purposes, you are bound by the Conditions of Use of the Cell Tracking Challenge:
